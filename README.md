# OOP-BASICS

We must create our own OOP classes architecture in order to practice and understand well what we have been talking about OOP.

## Requirements

You must implement:

1. Base class that will be inherited at least once.
    This base case must have at least:
    -3 properties
    -3 methods
    -1 constructor and 1 destructor
2. One class that inherits the base class.
    This class must add:
    1 static property
    1 method
    This class must override:
    1 property
    1 method
3. One abstract class with at least:
    2 properties
    2 methods
4. One interface that must be implemented by one class.
    This interface must have at least 2 methods.

We show an Example of this with this topic:
1. Animal.php is the base class who implements the aliveAnimal.php interface
2. aliveAnimal.php is an interface with to methods.
3. Cat inherits the Animal.php.
4. Feline is an abstract class
